                    I am really into video games.
                    In my opinion, the harder the game the better the game. 
                    However, I also do enjoy some of the more relaxed and simplistic games.
                    To the left there is a list of some of the games I enjoy the most.

                My favourite game series is Assassin's Creed due to the historical accuracy and awesome playstyle.
                The playstyle of being able to choose either stealth, where you sneak up on your targets and assassinate them, or just brute force, where you fight all the enemies in the area and then kill your target after wiping out all the enemies with intense and brutal combat.
                My favourite Assassin's Creed game currently is <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/valhalla" alt="link to assassin's creed Valhalla's website">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>.
                This Assassin's Creed game is focused on the story of the vikings and the lore behind Norse Mythology.
                However there is new one dropping soon called <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/shadows" alt="Link to assassin's creed shadow's website">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> and this one will located in Japan and talking about the story of samurais.
               <br> My other hobbies include reading websites and surfing the web for information, and learning as much as I can.
               <br> I also love reading. 
                Reading has been a passion of mine ever since I was a kid. 
                I picked up reading when I was in 1st grade and by the time I was in 2nd on my way to 3rd I was reading huge chapter books for the fun of it. 
                As a 4th grader I read the whole <em>Harry Potter</em> and <em>Hunger Games</em> series.
