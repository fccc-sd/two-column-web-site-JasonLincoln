                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <br>
                Hello! My name is Jason Lincoln and I was born in Killeen, Texas on the Army base Fort Hood.
                I was born there due to my father being deployed and my mother staying on base at the time. 
                Since I was about one going on two years old, my mother moved to NorthWest Ohio where I have stayed ever since.
                I am currently a Junior in highschool at a trade school known as Four County.
                There are many labs here to help aspiring students to take ahold of their dream job and to pursue it before they graduate.
                The lab I chose is the Computer Programming and Game Design Lab.
                I chose this lab due to my fascination with the world of coding and my love for learning all I can in the electronic world.
                However of course, the primary reason was to code.
                My lab instructor for this lab is <a href="https://mrgeiger.com/">Mr. Geiger</a>

                <h3>My Family</h3>
                <br>
            I have two siblings, one brother and one sister.
            Out of the three of us I am the youngest by ten years. 
            I currently live with my mother and her boyfriend because both of my siblings have moved out and are living on their own.
            M brother has two kids, one girl and one boy
            My father is ex military. 
            He was apart of both the <em>United States Marines</em> and <em>United States Army</em>.
            The main reason why I moved to NW Ohio is so that my mother could be near her side of the family.
            My mother and father eventually split up and my father got stationed in Hawaii on a military base and eventually moved back to Missouri.
            Which is where his side of the family after being released from the military.
            While my father was stationed in Hawaii I would visit him during the summer, but now I go to Missouri to visit him.
