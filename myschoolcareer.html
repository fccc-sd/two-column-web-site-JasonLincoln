                <h3>My Athletic Career</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The first sport that I joined was the archery team at my school my 4th grade year. I have worked my way up from the bottom. 
                    In my first years I was shooting averages of only 150-180.
                    Now while I have been in highschool I average around 270 and My highest I have shot was a 288.
                    Ive been invested with archery because of all of the fun I have and that it helps me grow my focus. 
                    I have pushed myself to my limit every single year with the goal of getting better. 
                    My work eventually paid off when I reached top 3 in a tournament, however I wouldn't take that. 
                    I wanted to prove to myself that I could reach #1 in the tournament. 
                    I havn't achieved it yet, but I know that I will soon.
                   <br> 
                    I also participate in marching band at my school.
                    The instrument I play is the flute and I absolutely enjoy it.
                    Marching band is a lot, you have to make sure you're timing your steps properly with the beat and everyone else, 
                    make sure you are playing the right notes at the right time, focusing on the people around you as you play so you dont bump into someone as you're moving, 
                    and meanwhile looking at your music at the same time.
                    It requires a lot of practice, focus, and precision to be able to do it all properly.

                <h3>My Academics</h3>
                <br>
                <p>While in school I take a lot of pride in my academics.
                    I always try my best to score the best that I can in eveyrthing that I do in school.
                    Every year I usually graduate with atleast an A or higher in all of my classes. 
                    My favourite classes are science and math because of the vast knowledge they posess and because of how intriguing they are.
                    I had actually gone to a math competition at a university my sophmore year with a group of classmates and some upperclassmen. 
                    We didn't win, however it was a great learning experience and extremely fun.<br>
                    I also used to apart of the Quiz Bowl team at my school and we competed in tournaments of answering questions and getting points. 
                    It was basically like a whose the team that knew the most about topics of mostly hisory, science and math tournament.
                    Ive also competed in the Spelling Bee a few times however, I didn't get extremely far due to it being when I was younger and not as familiar with words as I am now.
